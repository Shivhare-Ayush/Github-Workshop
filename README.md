## Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Git Commands üå±

**Goal**: Learn basic Git commands and create your first commit

1. **Check repository status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Create a new file with your information**:
   ```bash
   echo -e "Name: Your Name  \nFavorite Programming Language: Your Language" > student-info.md
   ```

3. **Stage and commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add student-info.txt
   git commit -m "Add my student information"
   ```

4. **View commit history**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

### Exercise 2: Working with Branches üåø

**Goal**: Create and work with different branches

1. **Create and switch to a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <name>/my-project
   ```

2. **Create a simple project file**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   echo -e "# My First Project\n\nThis is a project I'm working on during the Github workshop." > my-project/README.md
   ```

3. **Commit your project**:
   ```bash
   git add my-project/
   git commit -m "Add my first project"
   ```

4. **Switch back to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

5. **List all branches**:
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

### Exercise 3: File Operations üìù

**Goal**: Practice adding, modifying, and removing files

1. **Switch to your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <name>/my-project
   ```

2. **Add a new file to your project**:
   ```bash
   echo "print('Hello, Git Workshop!')" > my-project/hello.py
   ```

3. **Modify an existing file**:
   ```bash
   echo -e "\n## Features\n- Learning Git\n- Having fun!" >> my-project/README.md
   ```

4. **Stage all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add hello.py and update README with features"
   ```

### Exercise 4: Merging Branches üîÄ

**Goal**: Learn how to merge branches

1. **Switch to AIM branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <name>/AIM
   ```

2. **Merge your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git merge <name>/my-project 
   ```

3. **Delete the feature branch (optional)**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d <name>/my-project
   ```

4. **View updated log**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```

### Exercise 5: Working with Remote Repositories üåê

**Goal**: Learn to push changes to GitHub

1. **Push your changes to GitHub (if you didnt fork then ignore)**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for collaboration**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <name>/collaboration
   ```

3. **Add a collaboration file**:
   ```bash
   echo "This file was created to practice collaboration!" > collaboration.md
   git add collaboration.md
   git commit -m "Add collaboration file"
   ```

4. **Push the new branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin <name>/collaboration
   ```

### Exercise 6: Simulating Merge Conflicts üí•

**Goal**: Learn to resolve merge conflicts

1. **Create two conflicting branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b branch-a
   echo "This is version A" > conflict-file.txt
   git add conflict-file.txt
   git commit -m "Add version A"
   
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b branch-b
   echo "This is version B" > conflict-file.txt
   git add conflict-file.txt
   git commit -m "Add version B"
   ```

2. **Merge and resolve conflict**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge branch-a
   git merge branch-b
   # This will create a conflict!
   ```

3. **Resolve the conflict by editing the file**:
   - Open `conflict-file.txt` in your editor
   - Choose which version to keep or combine both
   - Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)

4. **Complete the merge**:
   ```bash
   git add conflict-file.txt
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict between branch-a and branch-b"
   ```

## Advanced Exercises (Optional) üéØ

### Exercise 7: Undoing Changes

Practice using:
- `git checkout -- filename` (undo unstaged changes)
- `git reset HEAD filename` (unstage files)
- `git revert commit-hash` (revert a commit)

### Exercise 8: Interactive Rebase

Learn to clean up commit history:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
